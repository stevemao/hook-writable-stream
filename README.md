> Hooking into Node.js writable stream


Based on [this](https://gist.github.com/pguillory/729616) gist. Useful when you need to test Node writable streams such as stdout.


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev hook-writable-stream
```


## Usage

### Use a callback

```js
var hookWritableStream = require('hook-writable-stream');
var hook = hookWritableStream(process.stdout, false, function(string) {
  //=> string === 'hooked!\n'
});

console.log('hooked!');
hook.unhook();
console.log('unhooked!');
//=> 'unhooked!' is shown on your console
```

### Use as a stream

```js
var hookWritableStream = require('hook-writable-stream');
var through = require('through2');

var hook = hookWritableStream(process.stdout, false);
var stream = hook.stream;
stream.pipe(through(function(chunk, enc, cb) {
  //=> chunk.toString() === 'hooked!\n'
  cb(chunk);
}));

console.log('hooked!');
hook.unhook();
console.log('unhooked!');
//=> 'unhooked!' is shown on your console
```
